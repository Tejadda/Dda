Task 1: The Knightâ€™s Tour Problem
Create a function bool SolveKnightsTour(int[,] board, int moveX, int moveY, int moveCount, int[] xMove, int[] yMove) that attempts to solve the Knight's Tour problem using backtracking. The function should return true if a solution exists and false otherwise. The board represents the chessboard, moveX and moveY are the current coordinates of the knight, moveCount is the current move count, and xMove[], yMove[] are the possible next moves for the knight. Fill the chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. Keep the  chessboard size to 8x8.
