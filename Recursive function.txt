Assignment 2:
=============
 Recursive Function and Efficiency Analysis - Write a recursive function pseudocode and calculate the nth Fibonacci number and use Big O notation to analyze its efficiency. Compare this with an iterative approach and discuss the pros and cons in terms of space and time complexity.

function fibonacci(n)
    if n <= 1 then
        return n
    else
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    end if
end function
